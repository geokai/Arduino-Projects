#Liquid Crystal Display Animation

This project is based on [Jeremy Blum's](https://www.youtube.com/user/sciguy14/featured) excellent *Turorial Series for Arduino* lecture series, *Tutorial 13*

This project uses an *HD44780* compatable, 16x2 character display in 4 bit mode, utilizing custom characters.

The characters are animated pixel-line by pixel-line by way of nested *for loops*.

Observations:
â€¢ The display *clearing* could use a more robust method than the printing of 16 spaces.
